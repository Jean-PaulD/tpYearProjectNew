CPUT Hang Outs

Description
CPUT hang outs consists of a website that allows users(cput students) to plan gatherings such as parties, meet new friends with similar interests or find romance. 

How it works
A student willregister with his or her student email to confirm that the student a cput student and will then be required to upload a picture(s) of themselves. Once a student is regsitered her/she will be be asked to select a username and upload a picture(s) of themselves, their age, what they are studying, and what their 3 main interests are for using the site. Students will be able to send messages to each other which wil be send a limited amount of messages to each before deciding on whether or not to meet. 
A student will make a post telling people what he or she wants do to, e.g hang out, study etc. SOmeone will comment saying they are interested. 

WHy this systen?
This is system is intended for students who wish to meet up with other students to make new friends or just hang out. It can make it very easy to start study groups or even start a regligious or a hang out group etc. 
Many students struggle wth certain subjects and lack focus during exams times. I am one of those students and creating such a system could prove benificial for those who wish to hang out with more dedicated people and strengthen themselves in which ever subject they would like to study at whatever time. So i decided to go with this idea but instead make it broader to include any category of "hanging out"
